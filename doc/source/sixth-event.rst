Another amazing battle of wits at the Creek as 4 chess
veterans came together once again. We sat at table 8
which has room for three chess boards with clocks. A larger
table about 8 people can sit here along with all my chess gear.

Today I shared a pizza with another man.
I think the pizza is best for 3 people or more since I had
trouble eating most of it.

A lovely woman delivered the hot pizza to our table and we
did have a brief chat about the club and I did give her my
business card. She seemed to think it was great having chess
at the creek.

I lost 2 of games blitz with 5 minute time controls to a younger
guy. We did play another game of rapid chess with 15 minutes each
and I was leading on material a Queen versus a Rook but I lost on time.

I played with an older man a competitive game of classical chess with no clock
and I did win in the end the other man resigned. We played a second game of
classical and agreed on a draw when other players arrived to play.
