Second Event
============

Breakfast Creek Hotel
---------------------

Tuesday 14th October 4:15pm start until about 5:45pm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

5 people attended this fabulous second event. We sat
at table 7. My friend Tony ordered a beer and a steak
sandwich with chips. The size of Tony's meal seemed
large. I ordered a lemon squash which was about $4.50.

I think the managers name was Fergus. One of the other
chess players had never been to the Creek so I gave him
a quick walkthrough show and tell.

I lost all 7 games of chess that I played. All games today
were 5 minute blitz games.

.. note:: "For A Hard Earned Thirst." In 2004, `Victoria Bitter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Bitter>`__
          commanded more than a 25 per cent market share, meaning that one in four beers sold in Australia was a VB.
