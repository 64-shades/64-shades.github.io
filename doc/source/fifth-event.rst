Fifth Event
============

Breakfast Creek Hotel
---------------------

Monday 24th November 4:45pm start until 6:20pm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Was the fifth event and I did finally order a meal. A steak sandwich with chips which
was a large serving and the meat seemed very succulent.
Another player ordered a pork sandwich which came with chips.

I did in fact win 2 games on time and drew one game. All games played today were
5 minute blitz. Today we sat at table 7.

Wonderful to grab a lift home after chess from another player at 6:24pm.
