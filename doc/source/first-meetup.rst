^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The very first event for our club was a success since
two games of chess were played,

3 people attended this meetup including myself and
an older man and Henry a worker at the Hotel. 2 games
of chess were played and I won both. First I played
Henry and won with checkmate and then in the second
game the older man resigned. The first game was blitz
and the second game was classical.

I also met 4 other Hotel workers including Dylan, Ryan,
Zach and Zara.  I ordered a lemonade.
