    <a href="https://thebigissue.org.au/">The Big Issue</a> is a social
    enterprise that publishes a fortnightly magazine sold on the streets by
    people experiencing homelessness, marginalisation, and disadvantage. The
    magazine is a tool for vendors to earn an income, build confidence, and
    connect with the community. Beyond the magazine, The Big Issue also runs
    other social enterprises like the
