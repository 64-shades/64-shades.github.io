^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The very first event for our club was a success since
two games of chess were played and we met a another great
bunch of people.

3 people attended this meetup including myself, an older
man and Henry a worker at the Hotel. We sat at table 7
and I won both games. First I played Henry with 8 minutes
each and won with checkmate. In the second game with the
older man we played classical and he resigned.

I also met 4 other Hotel workers including Dylan a bar worker,
Ryan and Zach both managers and Zara a waitress.
I ordered a lemonade.
