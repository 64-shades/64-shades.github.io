.. topic:: Measurement

   .. important:: Units of Measurement: CGS, MKS and FPI are measurement systems used by mathematicians and physicists. Centimeter-gram-second and meter-kilogram-second systems are called SI and MKS is the most popular system. Foot-Pound-Inch measurements or FPI are a system of units for torque used in engineering tasks with turning forces.

   .. tip:: A queen can cover at most 27 squares on a chessboard when placed on one of the four central squares.
