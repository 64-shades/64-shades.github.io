Fourth Event
============

Breakfast Creek Hotel
---------------------

Monday 17th November 4:15pm start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We sat at table 8.

A tradesman was eating a steak at a nearby table and he
thought that chess or games at Breakie Creek was a
great idea.
I remember we had a good conversation at the start of the event.
I gave him my business card.

I did speak to another two young women about the club
and gave them my business card with the clubs details.
I can remember they ordered a beverage each and not long
after out came a steak meal and a pizza.
They were sitting at table 9.
