History of 64 Shades
====================

Playing board games at the Breakfast Creek Hotel had always been one of John's ideas.
Whilst online games are very popular, the board game market is really
a niche industry with games such as Chess, Checkers, Monopoly and Scrabble being some of the most
played and fairly well known with other modern games like Catan and Ticket to Ride
also having been played by many in recent times.

Chess seems to be a universal language among gamers of all ages and pub chess generally seems
to be popular at most locations. We started the club online both on
`chess.com <https://www.chess.com/club/64-shades>`__ and
`GitHub <https://github.com/64-shades>`__ years ago and also have a large team on
`lichess <https://lichess.org/team/64-shades>`__.
