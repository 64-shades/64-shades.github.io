# Contributing to En Passant

Thank you for your interest in contributing to En Passant documentation! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you're fixing a typo, improving existing content, or adding new documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python** - Required for building the documentation
- **Git** - For version control
- Basic familiarity with **reStructuredText (RST)** markup (don't worry, it's easy to learn!)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page

2. **Clone your fork**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/64-shades.github.io.git
   cd 64-shades.github.io
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
   cd doc
   pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
```

4. **Create a branch for your changes**
```bash
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
```
   Use prefixes like `fix/`, `feature/`, `docs/`, or `update/` for your branch names.

## Building the Documentation Locally

To preview your changes before submitting:
```bash
cd doc
make html
```

The generated HTML site will be in the `doc/build/html` folder. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view your changes.

**Tip:** Run `make html` after each change to ensure your RST syntax is correct and the documentation builds without errors.

## Making Changes

### Documentation Guidelines

- **Use reStructuredText (RST)** - All documentation is written in RST format
- **Be clear and concise** - Write in simple, understandable language
- **Check spelling and grammar** - Proofread your contributions
- **Follow existing structure** - Match the style and formatting of existing documentation
- **Test your changes** - Always build locally to verify your changes render correctly

### Common RST Syntax

Here are some helpful RST patterns used in the project:
```rst
Headers
=======

Subheaders
----------

**bold text**
*italic text*

- Bullet point
- Another point

1. Numbered list
2. Second item

`inline code`

.. code-block:: python

   # Code block
   print("Hello, World!")

`Link text <https://example.com>`_
```

For more RST syntax, check the [reStructuredText documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html).
