## About the Site Generator

This site is built using ...

## Technology Stack

- [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/) is a Continuous Documentation Deployment platform designed to simplify the process of building, versioning, and hosting technical documentation, particularly for software projects. It operates on the principle of "docs as code," integrating with version control systems like Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to automatically build and update documentation whenever changes are committed to the repository.
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is a powerful and widely-used documentation generator written in Python. It is particularly popular within the Python community and is considered the de facto standard for documenting Python projects.
- [reStructuredText (RST)](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) is a lightweight markup language designed for creating easy-to-read and easy-to-write plaintext documents that can be automatically converted to various output formats, such as HTML, LaTeX (and thus PDF), and more. It is a key component of the Docutils project and is widely used in the Python community for writing technical documentation, including Python's official documentation and documentation for many Python libraries.

### Build the Documentation

Run the following commands from the repository root to create the Sphinx documentation with Make:

```shell
cd doc
make html
```

The generated HTML site will be in the `doc/build/html` folder.
You can open the HTML files with your web browser.
